Rust-Sudoku-Solver
==================

A basic application to solve sudokus using the Rust programming language.

## Why?

Because I needed an excuse to program something in Rust, and I was curious about if I could make a non-bruteforcing algorithm to solve a sudoku.

## How does it work?

Look at the documentation for the `sudoku` crate
