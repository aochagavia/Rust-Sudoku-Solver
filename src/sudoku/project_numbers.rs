/*

Implements methods to project each field
Projection means that we tell other fields which numbers they cannot contain
This will sometimes leave just one possibility, which becomes the number assigned to the field

Example:

123|456|78-

will become

123|456|789

If we project the numbers, we tell the blank field that it cannot be any number from 1 to 8
That means that it can only be 9

The same happens for squares:

123|
456|
78-|

will become

123|
456|
789|
